# **MTA Ridership & COVID-19 Impact Analysis**

## **Overview**
The COVID-19 pandemic drastically changed public transportation in NYC. Once bustling with millions of daily commuters, the subway, buses, and bridges saw an unprecedented drop in ridership. As restrictions eased, recovery was slow and uneven, with lasting changes in how people move through the city.

## **Key Trends**
- **Sharp Decline**: Subway and bus ridership dropped dramatically during the peak of the pandemic.
- **Shift in Mobility**: More people turned to cycling, walking, and ride-sharing apps.
- **Uneven Recovery**: Bridges and tunnels rebounded faster than public transit.
- **Long-Term Changes**: Remote work and safety concerns may have permanently altered commuting patterns.

## **Project Goals**
- Analyze ridership trends before, during, and after the pandemic.
- Identify behavioral shifts and their long-term impact.
- Visualize data through Power BI dashboards.

This project will explore how NYCâ€™s transit landscape has evolved, offering insights into the future of urban mobility.
